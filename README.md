# ShoppingCart üõí

The components are built focus on the reusability by multiple projects. The modularization was composed by:

- [CartEngine](./Packages/CartEngine/Sources): All the operations related to a cart, such add, remove, total price, with a generic API that can be used in any project.
- [NetworkEngine](./Packages/NetworkEngine/Sources): Simple HTTPClient that can be used in any project. Provides a contract and a default implementation using URLSession.
- [Marketplace](./Packages/Marketplace/Sources): The product and the cart feature, can be run in isolation of the main project.
- [CartApp](./Apps/CartApp): The main module, that create features and inject the dependencies.
